Translate the user instruction into git commands.
Rules:
- Only return lines that are git commands. No explanation.
- Prefer safe operations (status, add, commit, push, branch, checkout, fetch, pull).
- If a destructive command is required (reset --hard, clean, force push), ask for explicit confirmation by marking it as DESTRUCTIVE.

Context:
- Current branch: {{CurrentBranch}}
- Staged changes (porcelain):
{{StatusPorcelain}}
- Last commit message:
{{LastCommit}}
{{ConflictContext}}

User instruction:
"""
{{Instruction}}
"""

Output format:
One git command per line. If multiple steps are needed, list them in the order they should run.
